    <p>I am a passionate rugby and football enthusiast who enjoys the thrill of the game both on and off the field.
     Currently attending BYU, I balance my academic pursuits with the joy of being married.
      As the middle child in a family of five, I embrace the dynamic energy and connection that comes with having 
      siblings, making my life full of rich experiences and relationships.
    </p>
    <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have always been my favorite football team.
        Their legacy, grit, and determination on the field inspire me,
        and I love how they represent toughness and resilience.
        Watching their games is more than just entertainmentâ€”it's a tradition that fuels my own passion for sports.
        My time as a BYU rugby player has been incredibly fulfilling, both on and off the pitch.
        Rugby taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to push through challenges,
        values I carry with me in all aspects of life. 
        Representing BYU in a sport I love has been one of my proudest achievements.
